     <p>Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to
    develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by
    Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977, and sales of its computers, 
    among them the Apple II, grew quickly. It went public in 1980, to instant
    financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring
    innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh, announced 
    in a critically acclaimed advertisement, "1984", directed by Ridley Scott.
    The high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems.
    In 1985, Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably, while Jobs resigned to found NeXT,
    taking some Apple employees with him.</p>
